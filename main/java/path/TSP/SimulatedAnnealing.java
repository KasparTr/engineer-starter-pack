/**
 * Simulated annealing is a metaheuristical approach to optimization problems- problems with many different solutions, some better than others.
 * SA is a tradeoff approach between exploitation (always go higher, never lower- dangler of reaching local optimal, not global) and
 * exploration (taking a probabilistic chance of exploring worse routes in the hope of finding global optimal)

 Please note the few tips on how to choose the best simulation parameters:

 for small solution spaces itâ€™s better to lower the starting temperature and increase the cooling rate, as it will reduce the simulation time, without lose of quality
 for bigger solution spaces please choose the higher starting temperature and small cooling rate, as there will be more local minimas
 always provide enough time to simulate from the high to low temperature of the system
