 * the Ahoâ€“Corasick algorithm is a string-searching algorithm invented by Alfred V. Aho and Margaret J. Corasick.
 * It is a kind of dictionary-matching algorithm that locates elements of a finite set of strings (the "dictionary") within an input text.
 *
 * This algorithm uses Trie data-structure.
 * 1. Build a Trie from an array of Strings.
