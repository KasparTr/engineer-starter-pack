<h3>Singleton Pattern</h3>
<p><i>
Subclass of Creational patterns used to implement and support the creation of objects. Itâ€™s all about class instantiation.
Creational pattern can be subdivided into class-creation patterns and object-creational patterns.
Class creational patterns use inheritance effectively in the instantiation process.
Object-creation class use delegation effectively to get the task completed.</i></p>

<p>
Singleton pattern is one of the simplest design patterns in Java. In Singleton pattern, only single, global instance of a class is created. [1]

This pattern involves a single class which is responsible to create an object while making sure that only single object gets created.
This class provides a way to access its only object which can be accessed directly without need to instantiate the object of the class.[2]
