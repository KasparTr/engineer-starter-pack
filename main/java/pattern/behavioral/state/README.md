<h3>State</h3>

<p><i>Subclass of Behavioral patterns used to define the behavior of the objects. It is concerned with the communication between objects.</i></p>
<p>
Modify an objects behavior when its state changes.
</p>

<p>
If we have to change the behavior of an object based on its state, we can have a state variable in the Object. Then use if-else condition block to perform different actions based on the state. State design pattern is used to provide a systematic and loosely coupled way to achieve this through Context and State implementations.

State Pattern Context is the class that has a State reference to one of the concrete implementations of the State. Context forwards the request to the state object for processing. Letâ€™s understand this with a simple example.

Suppose we want to implement a TV Remote with a simple button to perform action. If the State is ON, it will turn on the TV and if state is OFF, it will turn off the TV.
